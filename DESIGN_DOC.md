Veterinary Practice Management App – Initial Design Document
1. Overview
Objective:
Develop a comprehensive web application using Google Apps Script that streamlines various operations for a veterinary practice. The app will integrate with Slack (free version) and incorporate an OpenAI helper for in-app assistance and change facilitation. The GUI will aim to have a nostalgic, playful feel reminiscent of the original Roller Coaster Tycoon game.

Key Principles:

Modularity: Each module should encapsulate a set of related functionalities.
User Intuitiveness: The app should be easy for staff to navigate with clear documentation.
Scalability & Maintainability: Use external version control (GitHub) and thorough inline documentation.
Integration-Ready: Slack integration and external API (OpenAI) components should be smoothly incorporated.
2. Architecture Overview
Technology Stack:

Frontend/GUI: Custom interface built with Google Apps Script’s HTML service (styled with CSS/JS) to emulate a Roller Coaster Tycoon aesthetic.
Backend: Google Apps Script to handle logic, database interactions (Google Sheets or Firebase for data storage), and integrations.
Version Control & Documentation: GitHub repository to manage code and design documents.
Integrations:
Slack Integration: For internal notifications, task capture, dashboard updates, and social interactions.
OpenAI Helper: A limited-access tool to analyze the codebase and assist with modifications (using a “rosetta stone” file for context).
Data Flow:

User actions in the GUI trigger Google Apps Script functions.
The script interacts with a centralized database and calls Slack APIs for notifications/updates.
OpenAI integration reads the rosetta stone file to assist with code adjustments and provide in-app guidance.
3. Module Breakdown
A. Employee & HR Management
Employee Database:

Functions:
Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) employee records.
Store contact info, roles, certifications, etc.
Considerations:
Can be a standalone module but will integrate with attendance, training, and feedback modules.
HR Functions & Onboarding:

Functions:
New employee onboarding workflows.
Role-based access controls and permissions.
Integration Points:
Links to Employee Database.
Integrated with Slack for notifications and onboarding updates.
Attendance & Time Tracking:

Functions:
Clock in/out, track attendance.
Automated notifications for policy violations.
Integration Points:
Connected with employee records.
Slack notifications for alerts.
B. Operational & Management Functions
Appointment Flow Whiteboard:

Functions:
Visual scheduling interface.
Drag-and-drop appointment management.
Fine-tuning options for appointment details.
Considerations:
This module is specialized and may require iterative prototyping.
Project & Meeting Management:

Functions:
Schedule meetings, manage project tasks.
Record meeting notes and follow-ups.
Integration Points:
Can integrate with employee calendars and Slack reminders.
Employee Training & Development:

Functions:
Track training progress.
Manage monthly 1-on-1 meetings, quarterly reviews, CE tracking, discipline records, etc.
Integration Points:
Tied to employee records and dashboards.
C. Employee Engagement & Feedback
Internal Social Module:
Functions:
Chat interface for employee communications.
Kudos/high-five system.
Badge system for gamification, including both preset and user-submitted badge designs.
Considerations:
Might merge some aspects of engagement and feedback here.
Feedback & Communication:
Functions:
Allow employees to send feedback to management (anonymous or otherwise).
Track and update the status of submitted feedback.
Integration Points:
Connects with HR and management dashboards.
D. Dashboard & User Interface
Customizable Dashboards:
Functions:
Different dashboards based on user roles (support staff vs. management).
Task management, meeting reminders, and training tracking.
Design:
Emulate the retro aesthetic of Roller Coaster Tycoon while remaining intuitive.
Integration Points:
Pulls data from all modules to provide an overview.
E. Integrations & Advanced Features
Slack Integration:
Functions:
Display and update dashboards on user Slack canvases.
Allow task capture, “save-for-later” features, and message snippet capturing.
Limitations:
Must comply with Slack Free version restrictions.
OpenAI Helper Module:
Functions:
Use a “rosetta stone” file to understand app structure.
Assist with code changes and document modifications.
Security:
Strict permission controls for changes.
Integration Points:
Likely integrated with the GitHub repository for version tracking and documentation.
4. Documentation & Workflow Strategy
External Documentation:

Maintain a living document (this design doc) on GitHub (or similar platform) that is updated every session.
Version Control & Code Hosting:

Use GitHub for both code and documentation.
Consider a separate branch or directory for experimental features.
Session Handoff:

At the end of each session, update this document with progress notes and planned next steps.
When starting a new session, provide the latest version of this document to ensure continuity.
Commenting & In-Code Documentation:

Ensure each module and function is well-commented.
Maintain inline documentation and external documentation that explains high-level logic and inter-module relationships.
Integration Testing:

Regularly test Slack and OpenAI integrations with a focus on ensuring that the free versions and APIs behave as expected.
5. Roadmap & Milestones
Prototype Core Modules:

Begin with the Employee Database and HR Functions.
Validate Google Apps Script connectivity and data storage.
Develop Integration Layers:

Implement basic Slack notifications.
Test initial integration of the appointment whiteboard module.
Expand Modules:

Build out the Training, Engagement, and Feedback modules.
Iterate on the Dashboard UI, refining the Roller Coaster Tycoon style.
Implement Advanced Features:

Integrate the OpenAI Helper for in-app assistance.
Develop the “rosetta stone” file mechanism to support context-aware changes.
User Testing & Feedback:

Gather user input on ease of use and efficiency.
Adjust module boundaries if needed based on real-world usage.
6. Final Thoughts
This initial design document is meant to serve as the blueprint for our app development. As we move forward, we can refine module boundaries—for instance, merging the Employee Engagement and Feedback modules if they naturally overlap or keeping them separate if distinct functionalities emerge. The modular approach ensures that even if requirements change over time, the app remains scalable and maintainable.
